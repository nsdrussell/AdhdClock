Small on screen timer to help keep mind wandering in check. A little project for a friend with ADHD, he wanted an ADHD clock. It always stays on top, so should focus attention when there is a deadline.

To build, open the .sln with Visual Studio and press CTRL+F5. Written in VS2022 but any recent version should be fine.

Requires .NET 5.
